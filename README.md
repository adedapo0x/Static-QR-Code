### What I learned

Thought I had mastered HTML and CSS, so not getting it perfect at first try was kind of surprising. Maybe it is because I have been too immersed in my JavaScript journey. Knowing the image was not meant to be responsive helped me write lesser code too.

Better mastery of HTML and CSS basically.
